# 💼 Composite - Web Design Agency Website Clone

## 📝 Description
**Composite** is a frontend project that I created based on a web design agency template I found online. I recreated it from scratch for my learning experience. This project demonstrates frontend development skills by rebuilding the design and structure of a web design agency website, showcasing the services offered by a design company, and providing information about the team, portfolio, and client testimonials.

Developed for learning purposes, **Composite** uses modern web development practices to build a responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing website. The site also incorporates smooth scrolling animations powered by **GSAP** for a more engaging and interactive user experience.
